# nachos-os
Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System, or **Nachos**, is instructional software for teaching undergraduate, and potentially graduate level operating systems courses.

Originally written in C++ for MIPS, Nachos runs as a user-process on a host operating system. A MIPS simulator executes the code for any user programs running on top of the Nachos operating system. Ports of the Nachos code exist for a variety of architectures.
